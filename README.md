# Littlebuddies API

## This is a the API backend of the ecommerce mobile application I am currently building for my startup.

It is called Littlebuddies. It is a Uber-Eats type of app catered towards the Pet shop industry rather than the food industry.

What users can do?

- Users can shop from a variety of stores near their device location.
- Users can place orders and make payments via credit card through Paystack which has been integrated in the backend.
- Once an order is placed, the store will receive the order using the backend I created and the store may acknowledge the order which will send a notification to the users mobile device.
- The user will also receive notices about their order via email, including receipts.
- The store will then deliver the ordered goods to the customer.
